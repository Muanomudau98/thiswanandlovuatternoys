Key changes.
Interactive elements: Dropdown menus were added for navigation using JavaScript for smooth user interaction without relying on frameworks like jQuery.
Interactive map: OpenLayers was used to create a dynamic map showing office locations with clickable markers and smooth zoom animations.
Animations and transitions: CSS and OpenLayers’ animation methods provided smooth transitions for menus and map interactions.
Advanced DOM Manipulation: JavaScript dynamically created map popups and linked UI elements to map features for an interactive experience.
Gallery and lightbox: While a lightbox gallery was not implemented, social media icons are present, and adding a lightbox feature could be a future enhancement.
